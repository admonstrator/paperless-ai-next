/**
 * Regression coverage for issue #305: "Scan now" answered with an unlogged
 * HTTP 500.
 *
 * Two things went wrong together. POST /api/scan/now resolved the Paperless
 * user ID and refused to start the scan when that came back null — with no log
 * line at all, which is why the reporter saw a 500 and an empty log. And
 * getOwnUserID() came back null far too easily: it only ever matched
 * PAPERLESS_USERNAME against the usernames in /api/users/, so a display name, a
 * case difference, or a response the token user cannot fully see all ended in
 * the same silent null.
 *
 * The scan does not use the user ID at all, so neither the endpoint nor the
 * queue may gate on it — and since processDocument() never read the value it
 * was handed, the plumbing is gone rather than merely ungated. That leaves
 * getOwnUserID() with no caller in the processing path; it stays on the
 * service as a general Paperless helper, hardened, and is covered below so a
 * future caller inherits the fixed behaviour rather than the old one.
 *
 * The route file is read here rather than copied so the assertions cannot
 * drift away from it.
