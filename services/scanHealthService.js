/**
 * ScanHealthService
 *
 * Tracks whether the document scan loop is actually able to do its job.
 *
 * Background: the scan scheduler used to be armed only after a successful
 * Paperless-ngx preflight call. A single connection failure at container start
 * left the app running without any scheduled scan while /health still reported
 * "healthy". The scheduler is now armed unconditionally and every run reports
 * its outcome here, so /health, the dashboard and monitoring see the truth.
 *
 * The service holds state only — no I/O, no timers, no dependencies besides the
 * config. That keeps it free of circular requires and testable offline.
