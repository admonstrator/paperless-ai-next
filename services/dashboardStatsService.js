/**
 * DashboardStatsService
 *
 * Assembles the dashboard statistics payload once and serves it from memory.
 *
 * Background: /api/dashboard/stats rebuilt everything per request — two
 * uncached Paperless-ngx round trips (tag and correspondent counts) plus a
 * dozen SQLite queries, one of which read every row of openai_metrics into
 * memory just to average it. The dashboard polls that endpoint, and every open
 * browser tab polls it separately, so the cost scaled with the number of
 * viewers while the numbers themselves change only when a document is
 * processed.
 *
 * The payload is now built here at most once per TTL, refreshed in the
 * background, and invalidated by the scan loop when a document actually
 * changes something. Requests never wait on Paperless-ngx unless the cache is
 * empty.
 *
 * That last case — an empty cache — is the whole restart story, and every
 * safeguard here used to sit on the wrong side of it: the failure backoff was
 * reached only after a first successful build, and a build that never answered
 * kept the single-flight slot it hands to every later reader. A Paperless-ngx
 * still booting therefore left the endpoint hanging for the lifetime of the
 * process. Both are now handled before the cache exists, and buildStats() reads
 * its Paperless counts strictly so an outage fails the build instead of caching
 * itself as a library with nothing in it.
